    You will receive a question, its options, and the correct answer in HTML format.
    1. Read and understand the question and options.
    2. Give a short, clear explanation for why the correct answer is right.
    3. Use plain text only. If equations are needed, write them in LaTeX (surrounded by $...$).
    4. Do not include any HTML tags or formatting in your response.
    5. Your explanation must be strictly under 80 words.
    6. Do not mention the options or restate the question; focus only on explaining the answer.

    Examples:
    Example 1:
    Question:
    The total number of secondary hydrogen present in 3,3‚Äêdiethylpentane is      
    Options:
    1. 8
    2. 9
    3. 10
    4. 12
    Answer: 1
    
    Explanation: 3,3-diethylpentane has the structure $CH_3CH_2C(CH_2CH_3)_2CH_2CH_3$. There are four secondary carbon atoms: the two $CH_2$ groups in the main chain (at positions 2 and 4) and the two $CH_2$ groups of the ethyl branches. Each secondary carbon has two hydrogen atoms, so $4 \\times 2 = 8$ secondary hydrogens.

    Example 2:
    Question:
    Which of the following statement is correct?
    Options:
    1. In an elastic collision of two bodies the total momentum and energy of bodies is conserved
    2. Total energy of the system is always conserved no matter what internal and external forces on the body are present
    3. Work done in the motion of a body over a closed loop is zero for very very force in nature.
    4. In an inelastic collision, the final kinetic energy is always less than the intial kinetic energy of the system
    Answer: 2

    Explanation: An elastic collision is defined by the conservation of both the total momentum and the total kinetic energy of the colliding bodies. In such a collision, no kinetic energy is lost to other forms of energy like heat or sound.
    (Note: here option 1 is the actual correct answer, hence the actual answer is explained gracefully without mentioning the option number.)
